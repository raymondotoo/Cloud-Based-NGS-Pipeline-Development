# Cloud-Based NGS Pipeline Development

## Description

This repository contains a scalable and reproducible cloud-based pipeline for processing **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)** data. The pipeline is designed to automate common tasks involved in genomic and transcriptomic data analysis, including quality control, read alignment, variant calling, and differential expression analysis. The pipeline is built using **Nextflow** and **Snakemake**, and it is fully optimized for execution in cloud environments such as **AWS** and **GCP**, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets and parallelized processing.

## Features

- **Scalable**: Leverages cloud infrastructure to process large genomic datasets efficiently.
- **Reproducible**: Full pipeline versioning using Docker and Nextflow/Snakemake, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Modular**: Built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to tailor the pipeline to various NGS data types (RNA-seq, DNA-seq, etc.).
- **Automated**: Streamlined job submission, data transfer, and result generation.
- **Cloud-Optimized**: Seamless integration with cloud services such as AWS and GCP for optimized compute resources.

## Requirements

Before running this pipeline, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Nextflow**: [Install Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html)
- **Snakemake**: [Install Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **AWS CLI**: [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) (for AWS cloud execution)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: [Install GCP SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for GCP cloud execution)

## Installation
