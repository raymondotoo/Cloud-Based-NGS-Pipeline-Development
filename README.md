# Cloud-Based NGS Pipeline Development

## Description

This repository contains a scalable and reproducible cloud-based pipeline for processing **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)** data. The pipeline is designed to automate common tasks involved in genomic and transcriptomic data analysis, including quality control, read alignment, variant calling, and differential expression analysis. The pipeline is built using **Nextflow** and **Snakemake**, and it is fully optimized for execution in cloud environments such as **AWS** and **GCP**, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets and parallelized processing.

## Features

- **Scalable**: Leverages cloud infrastructure to process large genomic datasets efficiently.
- **Reproducible**: Full pipeline versioning using Docker and Nextflow/Snakemake, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Modular**: Built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to tailor the pipeline to various NGS data types (RNA-seq, DNA-seq, etc.).
- **Automated**: Streamlined job submission, data transfer, and result generation.
- **Cloud-Optimized**: Seamless integration with cloud services such as AWS and GCP for optimized compute resources.

## Pipeline Overview

This cloud-based NGS pipeline is designed to process high-throughput sequencing data, such as RNA-seq and DNA-seq, by automating several key tasks in genomic analysis. Below is an overview of the major steps in the pipeline:

### 1. **Quality Control**
   - **Objective**: Assess the quality of the raw sequencing data to identify any potential issues before downstream analysis.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **FastQC**: Provides a detailed report on the quality of sequencing reads.
     - **MultiQC**: Aggregates FastQC reports into a single, comprehensive summary.
   - **Outputs**:
     - HTML reports that summarize data quality, including metrics such as GC content, base quality, and adapter contamination.
   
### 2. **Read Alignment**
   - **Objective**: Align sequencing reads to a reference genome to generate mapped reads for further analysis.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **STAR**: A fast RNA-seq aligner used to align reads to a reference genome (specifically for RNA-seq data).
     - **BWA**: A popular DNA-seq aligner used to align short DNA reads to a reference genome (specifically for DNA-seq data).
   - **Outputs**:
     - BAM files containing the aligned sequencing reads.
   
### 3. **Variant Calling** (for DNA-seq)
   - **Objective**: Identify variants (SNPs, INDELs) in the aligned data that may indicate genetic differences.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **GATK**: A widely used toolkit for variant discovery in DNA-seq data.
     - **Samtools**: Provides utilities to manipulate BAM files and perform variant calling.
   - **Outputs**:
     - VCF files containing the identified variants.
   
### 4. **Differential Expression Analysis** (for RNA-seq)
   - **Objective**: Identify genes that are differentially expressed between experimental conditions.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **DESeq2**: A robust tool for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.
     - **EdgeR**: Another tool for differential gene expression analysis, commonly used for RNA-seq data.
   - **Outputs**:
     - A list of differentially expressed genes, including fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values.
   
### 5. **Visualization**
   - **Objective**: Create plots and visualizations to interpret the results from the analysis.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **R (ggplot2, EnhancedVolcano, pheatmap)**: Used to create various plots such as volcano plots, heatmaps, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) plots.
     - **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Additional tools for generating visualizations such as heatmaps and clustering plots.
   - **Outputs**:
     - Visualizations for differential expression analysis, clustering, and sample comparison (e.g., volcano plots, heatmaps, PCoA plots).
   
### 6. **Result Generation & Reporting**
   - **Objective**: Summarize and compile all the analysis results into a final report.
   - **Tools Used**:
     - **R Markdown**: For generating automated, reproducible reports from R scripts.
     - **Jupyter Notebooks**: For Python-based reports that include visualizations and analysis results.
   - **Outputs**:
     - Comprehensive analysis reports, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and interpretations.

### Summary of Data Flow:
1. Raw data enters the pipeline.
2. Quality control (QC) checks are performed to ensure good data quality.
3. Reads are aligned to a reference genome (RNA-seq or DNA-seq).
4. For DNA-seq, variants are called, and for RNA-seq, differential expression is analyzed.
5. Visualizations and reports are generated to interpret and summarize the analysis.
6. Results are provided in the form of tables, plots, and comprehensive reports.

This modular pipeline ensures that genomic analyses are performed in a standardized and reproducible manner, making it easy to scale up and adapt for different types of sequencing data and analysis needs.
